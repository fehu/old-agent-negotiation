- [x] use timestamps guarded on report creation, instead of the own
- [x] use ScalaTags
- [x] the reports must be sent in bulk in a fixed interval
- [x] the reports should be stored on server-side as sets (to avoid duplicates, that are quite possible)
- [x] responses should be grouped by proposals
- [x] cache constructed rows
- [x] responses that are processed before the corresponding proposal should not be discarded
- [ ] conflict reports
- [x] acceptance in StateReport
- [ ] table rows should be paginated (and filtered) in code, not DOM; it cases major freezes if there is a lot of messages
